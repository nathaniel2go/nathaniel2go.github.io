My journey began with an interest in all sorts of animated medium. From tv shows, youtube videos, movies, anime, and others, it's a form of graphical media that's been a staple for years, and one that I've been meaning to create.
I have 0 traditional art experience, not having paid attention in middle school visual arts, nor have taken any studio courses in high school. Thus started a long journey of learning the fundamentals before touching cursour to timeline.

## Setting up the workspace

I could've animated using a stick figure, but I decided to at least look at something "cute" so I chose Sucrose from Genshin Impact to be my test dummy for my animation career. I trolled through the internet to look for guides on how to setup rigging, inverse kinematics, bones, and etc. The first method I used was not as good as the latter, with the later one being a robust Rigify setup. The first used the placement and movement of individual bones while the later uses rings and control boxes that control groups (with the option to control individual bones for finer movement)
I never experimented with shaders as I never got around to environments and objects, but this may change in the future. Whatever shaders came baked into the suite of Genshin Impact animation tools were the ones I used.

## The Start

The twleve fundamentals of animation are... I'm realistically not going to list or <em>teach</em> you about them all, but I will mention them when they're relevant. This material was foreign to me, but not completely unfamiliar to concepts in music theory; those being elements that shape and give the pieces character and emotion.
I began animation on 1s at 24 fps which was pretty standard. I worked using reference videos from youtube channel: 株式会社モーションアクター（Motion Actor Inc）or tag @MotionActorInc. I based my animations on various videos which are likely lost to time through the sea of fantastic action reference videos. The following is one of the more polished versions of this part of my animation journey, and likely came about ~2 weeks after beginning.

## Refinement

There are many projects between the video above and the following, all of which were spent improving on these fundamentals and getting used to the animation workflow.
