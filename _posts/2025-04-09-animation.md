My journey began with an interest in all sorts of animated medium. From tv shows, youtube videos, movies, anime, and others, it's a form of graphical media that's been a staple for years, and one that I've been meaning to create.
I have 0 traditional art experience, not having paid attention in middle school visual arts, nor have taken any studio courses in high school. Thus started a long journey of learning the fundamentals before touching cursour to timeline.

## Setting up the workspace

I could've animated using a stick figure, but I decided to at least look at something "cute" so I chose Sucrose from Genshin Impact to be my test dummy for my animation career. I trolled through the internet to look for guides on how to setup rigging, inverse kinematics, bones, and etc. The first method I used was not as good as the latter, with the later one being a robust Rigify setup. The first used the placement and movement of individual bones while the later uses rings and control boxes that control groups (with the option to control individual bones for finer movement)
I never experimented with shaders as I never got around to environments and objects, but this may change in the future. Whatever shaders came baked into the suite of Genshin Impact animation tools were the ones I used.

## The Start

The twleve fundamentals of animation are... I'm realistically not going to list or <em>teach</em> you about them all, but I will mention them when they're relevant. This material was foreign to me, but not completely unfamiliar to concepts in music theory; those being elements that shape and give the pieces character and emotion.
I began animation on 1s at 24 fps which was pretty standard. I worked using reference videos from youtube channel: 株式会社モーションアクター（Motion Actor Inc）or tag @MotionActorInc. I based my animations on various videos which are likely lost to time through the sea of fantastic action reference videos. The following is one of the more polished versions of this part of my animation journey, and likely came about ~2 weeks after beginning.

## Refinement

There are many projects between the video above and the following events, all of which were spent improving on these fundamentals and getting used to the animation workflow.

## Refinement

There are many projects between the video above and the following, all of which were spent improving on these fundamentals and getting used to the animation workflow. Over time using these keybinds, blender features, camera movement, and character movement became more natural. This is obvious as practice begets familiarity, but what I could do in an hr session at the beginning quickly became a short 15 minutes task. Combining synthesized knowledge with tool muscle memory made animation much cleaner and smoother. 

This is also around the time that I started animation using breakdowns, extremes, and inbetweens. Before I used a very linear system, working from point A to B frame by frame. There are benefits to this, but I often found myself modifying poses mid animation, which meant changing all of the previous and future frames. Utilizing breakdowns helped to improve my posing, as I could focus time on perfecting certain poses, then working inbetween them. I typically did the start, the end, then the middle with more breakdowns dividing the main ones. I then proceeded to work on extremes which usually included dramatic overshoots, then the inbetweens to smooth out the movement.

Around February, I began to animate on 2s instead of 1s. This was done to focus my efforts on posing and character expression rathan than the sheer number of frames (as I had to animate every other frame rather than every sequential one), but was also done because I am fond of the choppier, more exaggerated aesthetic. I took inspiration from arcade fighting games like Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat, with a more recent title being Skull Girls. The lead animator for Skull Girls had a great conference on the animation style and techniques used which I hinged some of my main animation projects on. [INSERT PHOTO OF TIMELINES]  

The following is a short made up fighting kit of Sucrose's character, containing a string of light attacks and an ultimate of sorts. For the light attacks I used a variety of generic fighting animations from characters that focused more on magic, spells, or summoning, while the ultimate was just for fun and modelled after an MLB baseball pitch.

This is my most polished animation project to date, and it's a short one for sure. My knowledge on environments, objects, and lighting is limited, and I predict that each element I add to my production will be another lengthy learning process. For this set of animations, I use a 'book' which was two rectangular prims, and 'bolts of magic' which were all manually animated. Particle animation with wind and fire interest me, but I suppose those things will have to come later. 

I will be putting this animation train on hold for more discipline related projects as the study term picks up. I don't plan on dropping this field as it interests me and I find it satisfying to work on and see completed projects.
