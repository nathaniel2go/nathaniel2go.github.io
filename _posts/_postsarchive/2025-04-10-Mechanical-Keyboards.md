Gaming accessories, RGEEBEE and general gamer products have become a bore. This started after my first keyboard, a Logitech G512 with their own blue clicky switches. I decided to switch because of the piercing sound and the gashes it left on my mouse from flicking it into the side of the board. The look, size, and sound were not ideal for me - thus began the journey.

# The Beginning: 2020
From thinking of switching off a laptop setup to a full desktop pc and dedicated keyboard, I began to explore my options. The G512 was my first board, and was suitable for a while. being able to use my laptop to the side, having 2 monitor, and generally having better setup ergonomics and space was great.

It's... something. It may be a statement on my photography in this time, but either way, the setup has evolved. At this point, the laptop was a few years old and starting to show signs of wear with some i7 8000 series processor and a mobile 1050ti. This prompted a change, which was included in the keyboards. (insert photos because I don't know where they are LOL)

My first board of choice was a chinese board from the storefront Kprepublic. I still purchase components from them occassionally, and in this case, I got the XD84 Pro, a plastic board with an aluminium plate. About as standard as you can get. For switches I picked up a set of Akko Ocean Blues which are now discontinued, and some Aliexpress XDA profile matcha switches. (Insert image of the board)

This was the first time I had ever soldered. As you imagine, it did not go well. The joints were bad but connected surprisingly. I continued with the process, but realized I had gotten pcb mount stabilizers and not clip ins! This mean I had to desolder all of my progress up to this point, lest I buy new stabilizers. Along with my first soldering experience was my first *de*soldering experience using copper solder wicks. (I doubt I have photos of this but insert if applicable)

After finishing my first board, I knew it wasn't over. I was looking at boards of different materials plate materials, switches, profiles, layouts, and enough decisions to give anyone chronic decision fatigue. After deliberating, research, and a well timed sale, I want for the Idobao ID80 Crystal. A unique gasket mounted board with a beautiful brass plate and acrylic body. The acoustic were a steup from a mold injection plastic board, but a pairing with Durock Alpine switches created a very high pitched plasticky sound profile. There was a lot of room for improvement, which some Gateron Milky Yellows just did.
