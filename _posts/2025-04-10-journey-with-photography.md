I've always been the 'family photographer'. Over the last few years, I have explored the art and technical aspects of photography and the entire production pipeline. I'll breifly explore my journey with the theory, the art, the editing, and more.

# The Beginning: Smartphone Photography
Smartphone cameras have come a long way. Many are capable of taking good but often overedited and oversharpened photos. Despite this being the case, carrying a device that is a *smartphone* and a camera is impressive in itself. The following are images starting from 2019 where I got my first phone, up to 2023 before I switched to taking photos on a dedicated mirrorless camera.

These photos are fine. I'm picking my favourites from thousands of photos across years, but they're fine. Manye of these photos are more documentation that photography, or 'aesthetically pleasing' instead of 'correct'. You can slowly see, however, the development of some core skills including basic composition, emphasis of a subject, and light.

# The Dawn of Sony
The late summer of 2023 is when I picked up the Sony a7iii. I've had access to a sony a55 for a while, but hadn't picked it up. Getting access to the a7iii from my grandfather gave me the pust to shoot and experiment with real dedicated camera photography. Youtube university was helpful to learn the controls and technical aspects of shooting on a mirrorless system, but also planted seeds of the basics of photography.

There is a definite and visible step in quality and focus. Simple as it may be, the transition from smartphones to cameras is apparent.
I personally feel that holding the camera body and 'taking photos' puts you in a different mindset as a smartphone. When I take photos on a smartphone, I feel that these are more for documentation, spontaneous photos, and a very point and shoot feel. As I pick up a camera, it's a different feeling, mindset, and even priorities begin to change. In these showcase photos they were at events of studio-style photographs, but these facts still stand.

I continued photographing school events, random things at home, and notably, sticker for my small sticker startup. I had to experiment with product photography for online outlets and social media, notably being Instagram, Reddit, and Etsy. I kept working on the fundamentals, while becoming more accustomed with the sony camera's systems and controls. 

During this time, I also heavily experimented with editing. I began shooting in RAW which almost always requires post processing,  thus I needed to learn how to make my photos look good. It began very simple with fixing the exposure and saturation of the photo, but I soon learned about powerful Lightroom features including texture, clarity, dehaze, and most importantly, masks. I wasn't sure of the usage and mostly placed things or slid sliders until things looked 'right', but I began exploring my tools and options.

My first majour photography session was in Norway which was quite demanding. Landscapes, city, people, and pretty things everywhere was challenging to capture, but I've got a few shots I'm proud of. This was the trip where I became accustomed to an active photography style, as the photos were always taken moving between point or activity A to B. I took full advantage of my Tamron 28-200 2.8-5.6, changing between wide open fjords and intimate moments with people or animals. It proved useful getting the framing I wanted at a specfic location while considering the limiations of tourist destination spaces and safety. The relatively slow aperture was not a majour concern as most of our excursions took place outside. We got a moderate amount of rain which proved challenging, but the ambient light through the clouds was more than enough to make up for it.

This was also great practice in feedback and photo sorting, as I came out of this trip with about 5000 photos. Many were from rapid bursts, while others were just spray and pray (also likely from burst shooting). Most of my days in Norway are now trimmed to photos I like or 'good' photos, with my judgement being quite generous as to preserve as much data as possible. The storage toll of RAW files is significant, but I have plans to expand storage in the future.
